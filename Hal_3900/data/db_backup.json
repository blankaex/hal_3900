well. the general consensus is that most are quite satisfied with the quality and promptness of lecture recordings. a frequent comment was that playing the lectures at 2x speed makes it appear as if jas is speaking at a normal speed. other benefits mentioned include not needing to travel to uni being able to rewatch certain parts of the lecture and skip parts as well. the latter isn't so much about lecture content but rather a student apparently introduces himself as raymond and frequently asks long questions that derail the lecture. perhaps it might be more economical to make all lecture streams web streams in the future. i also have a number of students who have previously completed comp2121 and comp1521 has not been excluded for them for some reason. i even have a student who is currently enrolled in comp6447 and i can tell he really does not belong in comp1521. i think the entire prereq/exclusion business is a bit of a mess at the moment. also regarding the quiz about lecture pace i understood this to mean the rate at which content was introduced. however a number of students seem to have interpreted this as how fast jas talks . without clarification the quiz results might not be entirely accurate.","answers":[{"text":"i second the exclusion comment. some of my friends and others i have heard of have taken comp1917/1927/2121/others and were told by the student office to do comp1521 anyway because that's what the degree says after changing degrees etc. a lot of them find the subject a bit of a breeze as a result... but i feel like in time the

about lectures and a lot of them 50 said they usually prefer to watch lectures later at home because they can watch it at 2x speed and do it in their own time/pace. about 25 of them said they still go to lectures the other 25 said they just weren t keeping up and planned to catch up. i think it s worth noting that there s a portion of second years that didn t take this subject last year for whatever reason and are able to cruise through the labs/content without attending lectures or doing much revision as they feel a lot more comfortable with programming at this stage. they seem quite switched on in the tutes and labs and are usually first to finish too. most people said they were quite comfortable with the lab this week a fair few of them finished early the tut content seemed to be pretty easy to follow for almost all of them","answers":[{"text":"the point about 2nd years is interesting. if that were a general issue then we could change the pre-reqs to require an extra programming course and then talk about the implementation of linked data structures . however we are constrained by the fact that other schools e.g. eet have comp1911- gt comp1521 as their only required comp courses and they're not going to be willing to add another course. it might be worth drilling down to find out how students who have just done either comp1511 or comp1911 are finding the course. is comp1911 sufficient preparation. as for why cse students might do the course in 2nd year ... some of the programs e.g. binf and seng have it scheduled in 2nd year in the program description. for those students it's a dip into how computer systems work under the hood and that's about all they need. these degrees have other constraints about courses to take in year 1. also i was trying to balance the size of classes in the two semesters rather than enrolments one semester being twice as large as in the other semester .","theta":1,"count":0},[{"text":"i taught comp1911 last semester as well as the bridging course those that did both seem like they're coping just fine in comp1911 whenever i see them and ask although that might be just because the bridging course takes students in a first in and best dressed manner. i would say comp1911 has enough preparation to cope with comp1521 in general though we didn't cover structs in overly great detail nor did we make them to use them as much as compared to comp1511 pointers were only used for passing things by reference/value and we tended not to go into detail about the layout of things in memory beyond bits

themselves perhaps they'll understand it a bit better having been through the process. i thought the assignment seemed fairly straightforward the main thing students are asking me for help with is memory exceptions and not being sure how to debug them. perhaps they're having more issues because there's more movement of data and calculating the addresses is a bit more in-depth.","answers":[{"text":"i agree with ellen on the fork lab. on the assignment most students i spoke to 'completed' their code but couldn't debug it - perhaps less of a chance to test the

exercises for people to use to make sure they get some practice doing a variety of programming tasks in mips. many of them are similar to exercises you may have done in comp1511. you can access the page here http //z5214348.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/prac/ notes all of the mips exercises i've made available have 10 autotests you can run using check similar to how we do for lab exercises and have starting code usually just a main function skeleton or a simple loop to iterate through an array and print out values . i also made a simple utility to run mips code called 'run' which is included in the 'code.zip' in each practice exercise- it's just a basic c program which will either run '1521 spim -file lt file gt ' if on a cse machine or 'spim -file lt file gt ' if on your home computer assuming it can find the executable . also it will default to running exe.s or main.s files if it can find them in the current directory or you can pass in a mips file as the first argument ./run lt mips file gt . i hope that some of you find these exercises useful. i'll be posting more up as the week goes by - it takes me a while to sort out the autotests. if there is a high demand for them then i'll also post sample solutions for all of the exercises i can. kind regards and happy studying callum avery","answers":[{"text":"hi when i try to run the check main.s command for the question it tell

aligned for the most restricted-alignment component in the union which would be 8 because of the double . if you had an array of these unions that would be a plausible scenario. but this assumes that

name is the same as the address of x which is the same as the address of i. in this case the largest element is the array which is 19 characters long. however the size of the union is not 19 bytes

its size. hence we could loop through the array by index. but array of integer doesn't have ' 0' in its end. hence what could be another way to determine the case of terminating the loop. for example here i would like to fill in an array with 9. this for loop runs much more times than 10 and trigged seg fault at last. it seems p null is not the case that p reaches end of x. what could be the correct way to exit instead of the way in comment thank you","answers":[{"text":"c doesn't have an inbuilt way of getting the size of an int array you would usually store the size of the array and use that the way you did it the first time . edit the second way doesn't work because you are checking the pointer value p is not null rather than the value at x 9 which would be gotten with p. you can generally set a guard at the end of an array that tells it when to stop. this is how strings work with '/0'. in your example you are trying to use a similar technique with an int array - but you will have to manually set the guard value at the end of the array. null is a pointer value so you won't be able to set an int to null. another way is to calculate the final address in the array and use that to terminate the loop. you would have seen an example of that in lectures or tutes. but that's basically the same as using array

longer prints. also the loop only increments to 6 and not 8 as per the loop condition int i 0 for i 0 i lt 9 i printf d element in path is s n i path i printf d n i printf ---ending execute n this outputs 0 element in path is /import/glass/4/z5200681/bin-pc.i86.linux 0 1 element in path is /import/glass/4/z5200681/bin 1 2 element in path is /usr/local/bin 2 3 element in path is /usr/bin 3 4 element in path is /bin 4 5 element in path is null 5 6 element in path is null 6 interestingly when i change path i to path 2 the loops starts working again. int i 0 for i 0 i lt 9 i printf d element in path is s n i path 2 printf d n i printf ---ending execute n this outputs 0 element in path is /usr/local/bin 0 1 element in path is /usr/local/bin 1 2 element in path is /usr/local/bin 2 3 element in path is /usr/local/bin 3 4 element in path is /usr/local/bin 4 5 element in path is /usr/local/bin 5 6 element in path is /usr/local/bin 6 7 element in path is /usr/local/bin 7 8 element in path is

you know for sure that there are 9 elements in path i have no idea why the second loop terminates after 7 iterations but the fact that the last few iterations even work and show null is pure luck. if you use path 2 rather than path i it's hardly surprising that it runs for 9 iterations. why are you surprised","theta":1,"count":0},[{"text":"as mentioned the condition i lt 9 was just for testing. i was having some trouble with the correct condition which has since been resolved but as part of the troubleshooting i wanted to simplify my condition to check the operation of the loop. this is what led me to the above question - i wasn't sure why a printf statement would cause the loop to fail and actually it seems cause the child process to crash as the --ending execute line after the loop would not print whenever trying to print path i for values of i above 6. i understand that in this case maybe there is no path 7 or greater but i wouldn't think trying to print that string would have broken the loop. i thought at worst it may just print random data. when i gets to 5 and 6 i still prints something for printf d element in path is s n i path i lt span class redactor-invisible-space gt lt /span gt specifically 5 element in path is null 6 element in path is null even though path 5 and path 6 are null. i am not sure what is different about values of i above this which would actually cause the loop to break. i understand it may not print anything meaningful but i was surprised the loop if not the entire process broke as my understanding was the index i was a number of bytes past the start of the array.i also would have thought if it did try and access memory it wasn't allowed to it would have output an error of some sort to stdout but there has never been one.

locally rather than on the cse machines due to the issue with the new c libraries breaking dcc. my question is is this considered acceptable behaviour seeing as gcc allows it and i get the desired outcome or should i be editing the provided trim function to check for this alternatively should i be checking for this before the trim function is called. ideally i would like the trim function to deal with all of this. edit i would like to keep using dcc as its error checking is really useful so i would ideally like to resolve this within the code. thanks joe","answers":[{"text":"this is a bug

expanded other ways like regev and custom matching schemes could be used br different shells cd can have shortcuts bash allows naming directors in a global scope for quick switching to regularly used directories and many jump utility exist for custom path movement. in essence that's the real reason customization. path movement isn't a regulated thing and there are many schools of thaught about what's more efficient so different shells are allowed to do it in different ways. other utilities are very strictly regulated about how there task should be done so it makes sense to have one program

to the top so i'm just making a new post. original discussion lt header gt rui tong 4 days ago last modified 4 days ago lt /header gt i'm currently looking at the showcommandhistory function and basically i gather that i'm reading from a file pointer to the .mymysh_history file . is there really any purpose for doing this because when i look at the assignment i feel like it'd be much simpler to just store everything in the already defined global struct variable commandhistory and then read from that instead for the show function. and then call savecommandhistory before the program quits. whereas from what i see in this current implementation every time i want to add to my history i need to always store it in commandhistory and then write it out to .mymysh_history. which feels like i always need to write to 2 different places at once the struct and the file. thanks. lt header gt john shepherd 4 days ago last modified 4 days ago lt /header gt showcommandhistory writes to the file

thanks","answers":[{"text":"the short answer we're interested in the characters your code outputs not how it's painted by a heap of very slow software emulating an even slower terminal. the slightly longer and less cryptic answer the approach we're using in painting the marquee to the terminal is extremely naive for every frame we clear everything and then paint everything. in an ideal world the terminal could work out how to turn this into partial updates of the screen. in practice what you're seeing is that not happening. the way terminals work hasn't really changed much since 1978 with the introduction of the dec vt-100 terminal the terminals we use today or more accurately terminal emulators pretend to be vt-100 relatives of various denominations. these were powered by intel 8080 processors running at a blistering two megahertz and with very nearly no memory and words like optimised display update algorithm weren't the domain of hardware. the sequences of characters in the clear label -- if i recall correctly something like 033 h 033 2j -- is magic to clear all characters on the screen. the terminal emulator meditates upon its idea of what the screen looks like and updates it character by character or sequence by sequence so each step occurs effectively separately. at low speed the terminal emulator and the rest of the graphics pipeline can keep up but at high speed the terminal has to be painting nearly continuously which can cause the frame that's pushed into the raster buffer to be incorrect. what you're likely seeing then is a weird combination of multiple frames one fully painted with the cursor placed after the last newline and one that's being painted with a cursor being placed before characters are. exactly what is causing that would be a fun well fun weekend exercise in following data through the baklava-like layers of thin flaky delicious abstractions. an interesting challenge and one not worth marks but worth many many kudos and/or mars bars devise a faster screen painting algorithm for this assignment or for say a visual text editor like vi or emacs . there's a few interesting approaches that come to mind ... you may also like

use is 9 10 1000 which is 9000 so just leave other places nothing or a space 2. for display at t 0 should we have a column of the character stored in bigstring or should all the column be the column of thank you in advance","answers":[{"text":"hi feng you questions seem a little bit ambiguous. so for your first question why are you saying that the actual bytes we use is 9000 are you saying nscols is at size 9000 but that is not the total bytes we will use that s just the number of bytes the bigstring colum will use hence the actual byte bigstring uses is multipled by nrows and that is the maximum number of bytes it will take. and if you are saying what will happen if the input is shorter than the maximum then i would recommend you to read through the setupdisplay function variable thelength is passed to setupdisply function to tell setupdisplay to stop setting up as long as it hits the end of your input so it won t keep printing until reach the end of the bigstring. and for your question 2 are you saying after the first iteration the program will show the first column of bigstring and yes it will since the starting_col is set to ndcols-1 and i don t think we need to make it show nothing in the first iteration as the assignment specification just asked us to translate the c program but if you want u can simply set starting_col to ndcols it will fix the problem . and i also think you have some misunderstandings with respect to bigstring and display because if you want to change the starting column that will show after the first iteration you should alter the arrary display rather than big string as bigstring constantly stores the big version of our input and will not be altered once it is created and display is the actual picture of every frame we see from the
