your input so it won t keep printing until reach the end of the bigstring. and for your question 2 are you saying after the first iteration the program will show the first column of bigstring and yes it will since the starting_col is set to ndcols-1 and i don t think we need to make it show nothing in the first iteration as the assignment specification just asked us to translate the c program but if you want u can simply set starting_col to ndcols it will fix the problem . and i also think you have some misunderstandings with respect to bigstring and display because if you want to change the starting column that will show after the first iteration you should alter the arrary display rather than big string as bigstring constantly stores the big version of our input and will not be altered once it is created and display is the actual picture of every frame we see from the command line.","theta":1,"count":0},[{"text":"after a communication to her her first confusion was actually about

slow software emulating an even slower terminal. the slightly longer and less cryptic answer the approach we're using in painting the marquee to the terminal is extremely naive for every frame we clear everything and then paint everything. in an ideal world the terminal could work out how to turn this into partial updates of the screen. in practice what you're seeing is that not happening. the way terminals work hasn't really changed much since 1978 with the introduction of the dec vt-100 terminal the terminals we use today or more accurately terminal emulators pretend to be vt-100 relatives of various denominations. these were powered by intel 8080 processors running at a blistering two megahertz and with very nearly no memory and words like optimised display update algorithm weren't the domain of hardware. the sequences of characters in the clear label -- if i recall correctly something like 033 h 033 2j -- is magic to clear all characters on the screen. the terminal emulator meditates upon its idea of what the screen looks like and updates it character by character or sequence by sequence so each step occurs effectively separately. at low speed the terminal emulator and the rest of the graphics pipeline can keep up but at high speed the terminal has to be painting nearly continuously which can cause the frame that's pushed into the raster buffer to be incorrect. what you're likely seeing then is a weird combination of multiple frames one fully painted with the cursor placed after the last newline and one that's being painted with a cursor being placed before characters are. exactly what is causing that would be a fun well fun weekend exercise in following data through the baklava-like layers of thin flaky delicious abstractions. an interesting challenge and one not worth marks but worth many many kudos and/or mars bars devise a faster screen painting algorithm for this assignment or for say a visual text editor like vi or emacs

it's possible but you're not going to get sensible behaviour from main . at the very least all of your functions would need a prologue and an epilogue and set a dummy return value in $v0 . then your main could call the functions and have them return. in the case of isupper and islower the only plausible dummy return value would be 1 otherwise your program will stop with an error straight away.

starts at address 0x7ffffe00 and grows downwards so 0xf7e497d6 is clearly not an address on the stack. check the bits of your code that modify $sp and you'll probably find the instruction that's messing it up. if you single step through the program in qtspim it's easy to spot when the value changes to something bad since qtspim highlights the registers that were changed by the last

i deleted a comment on an old post i made because i realised that it doesn't bump it back to the top so i'm just making a new post. original discussion lt header gt rui tong 4 days ago last modified 4 days ago lt /header gt i'm currently looking at the showcommandhistory function and basically i gather that i'm reading from a file pointer to the .mymysh_history file . is there really any purpose for doing this because when i look at the assignment i feel like it'd be much simpler to just store everything in the already defined global struct variable commandhistory and then read from that instead for the show function. and then call savecommandhistory before the program quits. whereas from what i see in this current implementation every time i want to add to my history i need to always store it in commandhistory and then write it out to .mymysh_history. which feels like i always need to write to 2 different places at once the struct and the file. thanks. lt header gt john shepherd 4 days ago last modified 4 days ago lt /header gt showcommandhistory writes to the file handle.this allows you to double up using it interactively for the h command and to save the command history to the .mymysh_history fiile. lt footer gt reply lt /footer gt lt header gt rui tong 4 days ago lt /header gt hang on sorry about this jas but in that case what's the distinguishing factor between

showcommandhistory lt footer gt reply lt /footer gt deleted reply sort of thanks jas although i'm now wondering about this. from my understanding i may have misinterpreted but my understanding is that savecommandhistory call s showcommandhistory to ensure that showcommandhistory does the writing for me. but if my shell wants to exit now this is going to be problematic because the last thing i want is for my shell to print out a history log right before it exits. is there any way i can overcome this thanks","answers":[{"text":"and to clarify any and all functions can be edited added or removed.

cd is called. globbing is only one way a path can be expanded other ways like regev and custom matching schemes could be used br different shells cd can have shortcuts bash allows naming directors in a global scope for quick switching to regularly used directories and many jump utility exist for custom path movement. in essence that's the real reason customization. path movement isn't a regulated thing and there are many schools of thaught about what's more efficient so different shells are allowed to do it in different ways. other utilities are very strictly regulated about how there task should be done so it makes sense to have one program that does it exactly as defined. the only common thing for path traversing is that after all processing is done the result is stored in the unix

have been reading previous posts about the showcommandhistory and savecommandhistory functions and am still somewhat confused. i know we can use these or write our own if we want but given they are in the skeleton program files i figure i should try and use them unless i come up with a reason why not to. maybe my confusion is around their names. unintuitively to me the showcommandhistory function takes a fd to output/save to where the savecommandhistory function does not though it seems to be it should the other way around based on the function names. previous posts mention showcommandhistory should be called from savecommandhistory but the assignment specs to me imply the savecommandhistory function is only called on exiting the shell to write the history to file. showcommandhistory on the other hand could need to be called many times when h/history is typed into the shell before exit so calling it from savecommandhistory on exit doesn't seem logical. is there something i am missing

note that i'm running dcc locally rather than on the cse machines due to the issue with the new c libraries breaking dcc. my question is is this considered acceptable behaviour seeing as gcc allows it and i get the desired outcome or should i be editing the provided trim function to check for this alternatively should i be checking for this before the trim function is called. ideally i would like the trim function to deal with all of this. edit i would like to keep using dcc as its error checking is really useful so i would ideally like to resolve this within the code. thanks

i am having trouble with the char glob_command array i am using within the filenameexpand function to hold the possibly larger list of tokens to return back to main for execution. i can't seem to populate it with more than two string elements. i malloc the array as below based on the number of expanded paths in the paths struct after globbing plus the number of switch arguments identified in tokens args starting with '-' plus an extra element to hold the command being executed. i have confirmed the values used to calculate glob_command_size are correct while debugging this. char glob_command glob_command_size paths.gl_pathc switch_count 1 glob_command malloc glob_command_size sizeof char i am testing with a command such as ls -l -a intentionally with multiple switch arguments

loop to copy all switch arguments starting with '-' from tokens to glob_command i can only copy one string before the function breaks for i 1 j 1 tokens i null i printf current j is d and i is d n j i printf current tokens d s n i tokens i if tokens i 0 '-' printf found switch n strcpy glob_command j tokens i printf copied switch s n tokens i printf glob_command d is now s n i glob_command i j i have performed debugging by adding print statements and can confirm the second switch -a argument in the command ls -l -a is matched by the the line if tokens i 0 '-' but the strcpy function following that condition statement fails. glob_command 0 is now ls current j is 1 and i is 1 current tokens 1 -l found switch copied switch -l glob_command 1 is now -l current j is 2 and i is 2 current tokens 2

maybe create your own char array and malloc it to copy the strings from result.gl_pathv or maybe pass the actual result struct itself back to main and read through the expanded paths in result.gl_pathv. this would require a bit of tweaking though as the result.gl_pathv array doesn't hold the executable name and any of switches that execve needs so it needs to be massaged a bit to

notice that /cs1521/bin/mymysh will also tokenise ' t' which is the horizontal tab. are there any other characters that need to be used in tokenise no. it used to tokenise on and ' as well but we stopped doing that a while ago. 3. if i interrupt a command for example run sleep 10' then immediately press ctrl c both sleep and cs1521/bin/mymysh will exit. are we supposed to keep myshsh running when it is running a command and we press ctrl c follow cs1521/bin/mymysh. 4. for the redirection should we treat the commands like cat lt .c valid or not if .c matches exactly 1 file follow cs1521/bin/mymysh. 5. if i run a command like echo abcd gt .txt and .txt does not match and files with glob_nocheck glob will preserve exactly .txt and cs1521/bin/mymysh will actually create a file called .txt . is this correct or not follow cs1521/bin/mymysh. 6. should we print running xxxx ... -------------------- -------------------- returns xx to stdout or stderr stdout i.e. follow cs1521/bin/mymysh 7. should the error message printed by our myshsh matches exactly what cs1521/bin/mymysh prints if so what should be printed if fork execve malloc wait etc... fail since these errors rarely occur. you can assume that fork malloc wait won't fail. they won't fail during our testing. you can test an execve failure easily enough to see what cs1521/bin/mymysh does. it would have been useful to ask these kinds of questions two weeks ago in the period when we were tightening the spec. too late to change it now.","theta":1,"count":0}]},{"_id":"5cb9b083e8c9cd08205654a0","intent":"assignments","courseCode":"COMP1521","tags":[{"name":"forums","salience":0.5,"theta":1},{"name":"assignments","salience":0.5,"theta":1},{"name":"assignment

the fact that the last few iterations even work and show null is pure luck. if you use path 2 rather than path i it's hardly surprising that it runs for 9 iterations. why are you surprised","theta":1,"count":0},[{"text":"as mentioned the condition i lt 9 was just for testing. i was having some trouble with the correct condition which has since been resolved but as part of the troubleshooting i wanted to simplify my condition to check the operation of the loop. this is what led me to the above question - i wasn't sure why a printf statement would cause the loop to fail and actually it seems cause the child process to crash as the --ending execute line after the loop would not print whenever trying to print path i for values of i above 6. i understand that in this case maybe there is no path 7 or greater but i wouldn't think trying to print that string would have broken the loop. i thought at worst it may just print random data. when i gets to 5 and 6 i still prints something for printf d element in path is s n i path i lt span class redactor-invisible-space gt lt /span gt specifically 5 element in path is null 6 element in path is null even though path 5 and path 6 are null. i am not sure what is different about values of i above this which would actually cause the loop to break. i understand it may not print anything meaningful but i was surprised the loop if not the entire process broke as my understanding was the index i was a number of bytes past the start of the array.i also would have thought if it did try and access memory it wasn't allowed to it would have output an error of some sort to stdout but there has never been one.

modifying the makefile in the spim/ subdirectory of the source code to tell make where to install the executable and the exception handling code. after doing that installation is as simple as running

means that the parameter value being passed is a pointer to a bignum structure. n means that the parameter value being passed is an actual bignum object. you use no star if you simply want to supply a value to a function this is analogous to regular function arguments in maths . you use a star if you want to pass in a pointer to an object in the caller and the intention of the function is to change the thing being pointed to. think about scanf d amp x . the intention is to change the value of x so we need to pass a pointer to x to the scanf function. all of this might become clearer when we see

look at each page in terms of the array section maybe once and if they are needed to be looked at again then they will be loaded up again. otherwise the remaining total pages in the 'whole system'

returns a file descriptor here it checks if it's less than 0 but wouldn't it be better if we do in lt 3 instead cause we don't want 0 1 and 2 as file descriptors since they're default for stdin stdout and stderr. char buf max int nread while nread read in buf max 0 write 1 buf nread and this is the code for read read returns -1 when it fails shouldn't we check if nread gt 0 instead of 0 cheers","answers":[{"text":"for the open question checking for in lt 0 is correct. the open call won't allocate any of 0 1 or 2 because they're already in use so there's no use checking for them. if it succeeds it will return a value 3 or higher. if it fails it will return -1. no other values are relevant and only -1 is an error result. for the read question yes ... checking for the return value being gt 0 would probably be better. the code is assuming that there won't be errors and in that context the termination return value is 0.","theta":1,"count":0},[{"text":"thanks i'll just check them

would be another way to determine the end of an integer array when we define an integer array whatever by malloc or simply declaration. we would know its size. hence we could loop through the array by index. but array of integer doesn't have ' 0' in its end. hence what could be another way to determine the case of terminating the loop. for example here i would like to fill in an array with 9. this for loop runs much more times than 10 and trigged seg fault at last. it seems p null is not the case that p reaches end of x. what could be the correct way to exit instead of the way in comment thank you","answers":[{"text":"c doesn't have an inbuilt way of getting the size of an int array you would usually store the size of the array and use that the way you did it the first time . edit the second way doesn't work because you are checking the pointer value p is not null rather than the value at x 9 which would be gotten with p. you can generally set a guard at the end of an array that tells it when to stop. this is how strings work with '/0'. in your example you are trying to use a similar technique with an int array - but you will have to manually set the guard value at the end of the array. null is a pointer value so you won't be able to set an int to null. another way is to calculate the final address in the array and use that to terminate the loop. you would have seen an example of that in lectures or tutes. but that's basically the same as using array

occupies after its starting address. the size was always going to be close to 19 which is the size of the largest element in the union. the precise size probably depends on the c compiler. rounding it up the next multiple of 4 above 19 i.e. 20 would be plausible. some other compilers might round it up to the next multiple of 8 if it needed to be aligned for the most restricted-alignment component in the union which would be 8 because of the double . if you had an array of these unions that would be a plausible scenario. but this assumes that a double is 8 bytes. is this guaranteed in any event

the fork function the operating system creates a new process for us that is a fairly exact copy of the parent. the new process has its own address space think virtual memory that we just did in the labs but initially it copies the parent's address space. it assigns this new process a pid. the parent and the child will then run as separate processes. from the fork the parent gets a return value the os hands it the pid of the new process child just created. in the child we also return from fork even though technically the child didn't exist when the fork was called and the os hands the child

i've heard a lot of people had trouble with mips in the practice exam and still aren't confident programming in it so i made a bunch of practice exercises for people to use to make sure they get some practice doing a variety of programming tasks in mips. many of them are similar to exercises you may have done in comp1511. you can access the page here http //z5214348.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/prac/ notes all of the mips exercises i've made available have 10 autotests you can run using check similar to how we do for lab exercises and have starting code usually just a main function skeleton or a simple loop to iterate through an array and print out values . i also made a simple utility to run mips code called 'run' which is included in the 'code.zip' in each practice exercise- it's just a basic c program which will either run '1521 spim -file lt file gt ' if on a cse machine or 'spim -file lt file gt ' if on your home computer assuming it can find the executable . also it will default to running exe.s or main.s files if it can find them in the current directory or you can pass in a mips file as the first argument ./run lt mips file gt . i hope that some of you find these exercises useful. i'll be posting more up as the week goes by - it takes me a while to sort out the autotests. if there is a high demand for them then i'll also post sample solutions for all of the exercises i can. kind regards and happy studying callum avery","answers":[{"text":"hi when i try to run the check main.s command for the question it tell me bash check command not found so can i have some idea

are writing the majority of the code for it themselves perhaps they'll understand it a bit better having been through the process. i thought the assignment seemed fairly straightforward the main thing students are asking me for help with is memory exceptions and not being sure how to debug them. perhaps they're having more issues because there's more movement of data and calculating the addresses

in 2nd year in the program description. for those students it's a dip into how computer systems work under the hood and that's about all they need. these degrees have other constraints about courses

asked both of my classes about lecture attendance as well. the general consensus is that most are quite satisfied with the quality and promptness of lecture recordings. a frequent comment was that playing the lectures at 2x speed makes it appear as if jas is speaking at a normal speed. other benefits mentioned include not needing to travel to uni being able to rewatch certain parts of the lecture and skip parts as well. the latter isn't so much about lecture content but rather a student apparently introduces himself as raymond and frequently asks long questions that derail the lecture. perhaps it might be more economical to make all lecture streams web streams in the future. i also have a number of students who have previously completed comp2121 and comp1521 has not been excluded for them for some reason. i even have a student who is currently enrolled in comp6447 and i can tell he really does not belong in comp1521. i think the entire prereq/exclusion business is a bit of a mess at the moment. also regarding the quiz about lecture pace i understood this to mean the rate at which content was introduced. however a number of students seem to have interpreted this as how fast jas talks . without clarification the quiz results might not be entirely accurate.","answers":[{"text":"i second the exclusion comment. some of my friends and others i have heard of have taken comp1917/1927/2121/others and were told by the student office to do comp1521 anyway because that's what the degree says after changing degrees etc. a lot of them find the subject a bit of a breeze as a result... but i feel like in time the possibility for this to happen will be ruled out
