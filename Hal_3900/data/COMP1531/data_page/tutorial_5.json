base class shape. shape is a generic concept that represents any geometric shape such as a rectangle or a circle and is useful to encapsulate common data and behaviour shared by these different shapes e.g. color and methods to calculate the area and to scale. hence shape is a mere concept and it does not make sense to create an object instance of shape. hence the class shape should be defined as an abstract class. further the class shape would define methods area and scale but as it does not know how these methods are implemented that depends on the type of the shape it must define these methods as abstract methods forcing the classes derived from shape to implement the behaviour. the classes rectangle and circle can now inherit from the abstract class shape define their individual attributes and override the methods area scale to define their specific implementation. method overriding is a feature where derived classes can override the implementation of the methods defined in the super class with their own specific implementation. b"},{"intent":"content","courseCode":"COMP1531","tags":[{"name":"paragraph","salience":0.5,"theta":1}],"text":"note the above code shows two ways of
