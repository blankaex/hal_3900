now this will allow both get and post methods to be used. 2. using get method not recommended for security reasons you may also choose to send form inputs via get method in which case the input values can be retrieved by doing something like make request.args.get 'make' . not recommended cheers","theta":1,"count":0}]},{"intent":"assignments","courseCode":"COMP1531","tags":[{"name":"forums","salience":0.5,"theta":1},{"name":"tuts and labs","salience":0.5,"theta":1},{"name":"week 8","salience":0.5,"theta":1},{"name":"week 08 lab -
