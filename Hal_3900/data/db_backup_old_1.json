the discussion about memory addressing modes the following syntax and variations was used to provide different examples of symbolic indirect and indexed addressing a lw t0 var b lw t0 s0 i hadn t seen this syntax where a declaration a is combined with an instruction lw t0 var before in the lecture examples so can i first confirm what this does i understand the following lw t0 var would use the load word instruction to copy var in to the register t0 but what is the result when combined with a i believe the data stored in var not the memory address would be loaded into t0 but then the slide video then says this would result in computed address for a is 0x1008 given that amp var 0x1008 but why does a equal the memory location of var when it seems we are copying the data value of var into t0 secondly i think i also a little confused by the following line b lw t0 s0 leaving aside the b part of the line above for the moment because s0 is contained within parentheses it is treated like a pointer of sorts and the data within register s0 is interpreted as a memory address so the instruction would copy the data at the memory location specified in s0 into t0 i am wondering firstly how we would come to have a memory address in s0 would it be like in c where would would use the amp symbol to find the memory location of a variable which could then save to another secondly why again like in the first example does b end up computing to a value of 0x1000 when the value in s0 is 0x1000 i thought the idea of using parentheses around s0 means the data at memory address 0x1000 is copied not the value 0x1000 itself

have a column of the character stored in bigstring or should all the column be the column of thank you in advance","answers":[{"text":"hi feng you questions seem a little bit ambiguous so for your first question why are you saying that the actual bytes we use is 9000 are you saying nscols is at size 9000 but that is not the total bytes we will use that s just the number of bytes the bigstring colum will use hence the actual byte bigstring uses is multipled by nrows and that is the maximum number of bytes it will take and if you are saying what will happen if the input is shorter than the maximum then i would recommend you to read through the setupdisplay function variable thelength is passed to setupdisply function to tell setupdisplay to stop setting up as long as it hits the end of your input so it won t keep printing until reach the end of the bigstring and for your question 2 are you saying after the first iteration the program will show the first column of bigstring and yes it will since the starting col is set to ndcols 1 and i don t think we need to make it show nothing in the first iteration as the assignment specification just asked us to translate the c program but if you want u can simply set starting col to ndcols it will fix the problem and i also think you have some misunderstandings with respect to bigstring and display because if you want to change the starting column that will show after the first iteration you should alter the arrary display rather than big string as bigstring constantly stores the big version of our input and will not be altered once it is created and display is the actual picture of every frame we see from the command line","theta":1,"count":0},[{"text":"after a communication to her her first confusion was actually about the

software emulating an even slower terminal the slightly longer and less cryptic answer the approach we re using in painting the marquee to the terminal is extremely naive for every frame we clear everything and then paint everything in an ideal world the terminal could work out how to turn this into partial updates of the screen in practice what you re seeing is that not happening the way terminals work hasn t really changed much since 1978 with the introduction of the dec vt 100 terminal the terminals we use today or more accurately terminal emulators pretend to be vt 100 relatives of various denominations these were powered by intel 8080 processors running at a blistering two megahertz and with very nearly no memory and words like optimised display update algorithm weren t the domain of hardware the sequences of characters in the clear label if i recall correctly something like 033 h 033 2j is magic to clear all characters on the screen the terminal emulator meditates upon its idea of what the screen looks like and updates it character by character or sequence by sequence so each step occurs effectively separately at low speed the terminal emulator and the rest of the graphics pipeline can keep up but at high speed the terminal has to be painting nearly continuously which can cause the frame that s pushed into the raster buffer to be incorrect what you re likely seeing then is a weird combination of multiple frames one fully painted with the cursor placed after the last newline and one that s being painted with a cursor being placed before characters are exactly what is causing that would be a fun well fun weekend exercise in following data through the baklava like layers of thin flaky delicious abstractions an interesting challenge and one not worth marks but worth many many kudos and or mars bars devise a faster screen painting algorithm for this assignment or for say a visual text editor like vi or emacs there s a few interesting approaches

i deleted a comment on an old post i made because i realised that it doesn t bump it back to the top so i m just making a new post original discussion lt header gt rui tong 4 days ago last modified 4 days ago lt header gt i m currently looking at the showcommandhistory function and basically i gather that i m reading from a file pointer to the mymysh history file is there really any purpose for doing this because when i look at the assignment i feel like it d be much simpler to just store everything in the already defined global struct variable commandhistory and then read from that instead for the show function and then call savecommandhistory before the program quits whereas from what i see in this current implementation every time i want to add to my history i need to always store it in commandhistory and then write it out to mymysh history which feels like i always need to write to 2 different places at once the struct and the file thanks lt header gt john shepherd 4 days ago last modified 4 days ago lt header gt showcommandhistory writes to the file handle this allows you to double up using it interactively for the h command and to save the command history to the mymysh

footer gt reply lt footer gt deleted reply sort of thanks jas although i m now wondering about this from my understanding i may have misinterpreted but my understanding is that savecommandhistory call s showcommandhistory to ensure that showcommandhistory does the writing for me but if my shell wants to exit now this is going to be problematic because the last thing i want is for my shell to print out a history log right before it exits is there any way i can overcome this thanks","answers":[{"text":"and to clarify any and all functions can be edited added or removed its recommended to call

maybe create your own char array and malloc it to copy the strings from result gl pathv or maybe pass the actual result struct itself back to main and read through the expanded paths in result gl

line after the loop would not print whenever trying to print path i for values of i above 6 i understand that in this case maybe there is no path 7 or greater but i wouldn t think trying to print that string would have broken the loop i thought at worst it may just print random data when i gets to 5 and 6 i still prints something for printf d element in path is s n i path i lt span class redactor invisible space gt lt span gt specifically 5 element in path is null 6 element in path is null even though path 5 and path 6 are null i am not sure what is different about values of i above this which would actually cause the loop to break i understand it may not print anything meaningful but i was surprised the loop if not the entire process broke as my understanding was the index i was a number of bytes past the start of the array i also would have thought if it did try and access memory it wasn t allowed to it would have output an error of some sort to stdout but there has never been one

am looking at q8 from the tutorial and i am confused how the bitwise operations are working i know they do work as i compiled and ran the code but just not sure how so for example i understand to check if we have found a unicode character using 2 byte encoding we have the following masks defined define top4 0xf0 which is 11110000 and define mask2 0xc0 which is 11000000 i believe a 2 byte encoded unicode character will have the first byte in the form 110xxxxx and the second in the form 10xxxxxx to me that means the first byte must start with 110 and the second with 10 but all other bits can be any combination of 0s and 1s based on this understanding lets say i have a 2 byte character in this form 11011011 10110101 i have no idea what that represents but i believe it conforms to the 2 byte character encoding standard of unicode so in the following line of code from the answer to q8 if c amp top4 mask2 we perform a bitwise amp on the data at address c and the mask top4 11110000 in my example the first byte of my 2 byte character is 11011011 so by my calculations a bitwise amp on these would be c 11011011 top4 11110000 amp result 11010000 but the result is not the same as mask2 defined in the program as this is 0xc0 11000000 the value of mask2 seems assumes that the first byte of the 2 byte encoded character takes the form 11000000 and not 110xxxxx am i understanding the encoding of the multi byte characters wrong from what i can see the masks for 2 3 and 4 byte characters seem to imply the whole 1st byte must take a particular form not just the first 3 4 and 5 bits of the first byte respectively

pointers yet they reference memory in four different areas some are in the data section intptr and str1ptr some are in the main stack sintptr chptr others are elsewhere in the stack str2ptr while dbptr is at some very strange address 0x1 originally is this because the pointers haven t actually been pointed to something with something like the following int num int intptr amp num when i add the above content to the code i get the following output where intptr now has a value in the same memory as sinptr and chptr seems strange why some pointers hold addresses similiar and others hold different when none have been set up to point at something specifically etext 0x8048688 edata 0x804a020 end 0x804a024 intptr content 0xff96d3e4 sintptr content 0xff96d4bc chptr content 0xff96d4b4

you","answers":[{"text":"c doesn t have an inbuilt way of getting the size of an int array you would usually store the size of the array and use that the way you did it the first time edit the second way doesn t work because you are checking the pointer value p is not null rather than the value at x 9 which would be gotten with p you can generally set a guard at the end of an array that tells it when to stop this is how strings work with 0 in your example you are trying to use a similar technique with an int array but you will have to manually set the guard value at the end of the array null is a pointer value so you won t be able to set an int to null another way is to calculate the final address in the array and use that to terminate the loop you would have seen an example of that in

occupies after its starting address the size was always going to be close to 19 which is the size of the largest element in the union the precise size probably depends on the c compiler rounding it up the next multiple of 4 above 19 i e 20 would be plausible some other compilers might round it up to the next multiple of 8 if it needed to be aligned for the most restricted alignment component in the union which would be 8 because of the double if you had an array of these unions that would be a plausible scenario but this assumes that a double is 8 bytes is this guaranteed in any event these

what you read on the internet it s not multiple but alignment integers are 4 byte aligned hence since it is part of the union the union is 4 byte aligned this is not strictly necessarily but some

practice doing a variety of programming tasks in mips many of them are similar to exercises you may have done in comp1511 you can access the page here http z5214348 web cse unsw edu au prac notes all of the mips exercises i ve made available have 10 autotests you can run using check similar to how we do for lab exercises and have starting code usually just a main function skeleton or a simple loop to iterate through an array and print out values i also made a simple utility to run mips code called run which is included in the code zip in each practice exercise it s just a basic c program which will either run 1521 spim file lt file gt if on a cse machine or spim file lt file gt if on your home computer assuming it can find the executable also it will default to running exe s or main s files if it can find them in the current directory or you can pass in a mips file as the first argument run lt mips file gt i hope that some of you find these exercises useful i ll be posting more up as the

found last semester that the fork lab was completed fairly quickly but most students didn t seem to understand it unless we walked them through what was happening i think an exercise with forking is a good idea though eg fork to a particular depth and then stop or create n children and print pids info about them without making a fork bomb or maybe extending the alternating process one so they are writing the majority of the code for it themselves perhaps they ll understand it a bit better having been through the process i thought the assignment seemed fairly straightforward the main thing students are asking me for help with is memory exceptions and not being sure how to debug them perhaps they re having more issues because there s more movement of data and calculating the addresses is a bit more in depth","answers":[{"text":"i agree with ellen on the fork lab on the assignment most students i spoke to completed their code but couldn t debug it perhaps less of a chance to test the

i asked a lot of students individually this week about lectures and a lot of them 50 said they usually prefer to watch lectures later at home because they can watch it at 2x speed and do it in their own time pace about 25 of them said they still go to lectures the other 25 said they just weren t keeping up and planned to catch up i think it s worth noting that there s a portion of second years that didn t take this subject last year for whatever reason and are able to cruise through the labs content without attending lectures or doing much revision as they feel a lot more comfortable with programming at this stage they seem quite switched on in the tutes and labs and are usually first to finish too most people said they were quite comfortable with the lab this week a fair few of them finished early the tut content seemed to be pretty easy to follow for almost all of them","answers":[{"text":"the point about 2nd years is interesting if that were a general issue then we could change

them to use them as much as compared to comp1511 pointers were only used for passing things by reference value and we tended not to go into detail about the layout of things in memory beyond bits

asked both of my classes about lecture attendance as well the general consensus is that most are quite satisfied with the quality and promptness of lecture recordings a frequent comment was that playing the lectures at 2x speed makes it appear as if jas is speaking at a normal speed other benefits mentioned include not needing to travel to uni being able to rewatch certain parts of the lecture and skip parts as well the latter isn t so much about lecture content but rather a student apparently introduces himself as raymond and frequently asks long questions that derail the lecture perhaps it might be more economical to make all lecture streams web streams in the future i also have a number of students who have previously completed comp2121 and comp1521 has not been excluded for them for some reason i even have a student who is currently enrolled in comp6447 and i can tell he really does not belong in comp1521 i think the entire prereq exclusion business is a bit of a mess at the moment also regarding the quiz about lecture pace i understood this to mean the rate at which content was introduced however a number of students seem to have interpreted this as how fast jas talks without clarification the quiz results might not be entirely accurate","answers":[{"text":"i second the exclusion comment some of my friends and others i have heard of have taken comp1917 1927 2121 others and were told by the student office to do comp1521 anyway because that s what the degree says after changing degrees etc a lot of them find the subject a bit of a breeze as a result but i
