returned the copy will be automatically loaned to the user at the front of the waiting list and they will receive a notification... which i thought it means as soon as the copy is returned it will appear as burrowed by another person on the waiting list so its status is still on loan . but then it also says the notified user follows the same steps to loan the item . which got me wonder what if the notified user say he no longer wanted to burrow that copy doesn't follow the steps to loan the book after receiving the email in that case is the copy still loaned to him automatically i'm mainly confused about the copy will be automatically loaned to the user bit since if it's already automatically loaned to another user the loaning process should be already done in the system internally then why does the user still need to follow the steps to loan the copy also do we consider the notified user as an external participant with a participate line drawn between send email and the first user on the waiting list or since the notified user will then login to the system and follow the whole burrowing process again in order to loan the copy he is simply a regular initiating actor user which will just go back to the start of the diagram so we don't have to include more stuff after the send email use case thanks","answers":[{"text":"hi shangjie as for the first question you may assume either way - as long as you write down your assumptions next to your diagrams. whether or not you assume that the copy will be automatically loaned the use-case for sending an email does not require the first user on the waiting list to contribute in the process of emailing and even if they are indirectly involved with the process since they will be receiving the email this is external to the

you may print out characters with the same count in any order - except the pytest does not account for it - so i have put up a more flexible and proper test on the labs page please copy and replace

design currently our providers and patients and healthcentres are all stored in one object and that object returns those items given differing parameters such as id or email or a search term . would it be better to have a searching object and for us to inject into that object an object that holds either providers patients or healthcentres where each of these objects have the same methods . part of the reason why i'm asking is that the searching object and the object containing the patients providers healthcentres should have an aggregation relationship but when you pass an object like def __init__ self object does this not make the relationship between these objects a composition","answers":[{"text":"hi ricky both your current approach and the suggested approach seems acceptable as i can see that they both hold their own benefits. i will not be giving a definite answer but i would like to make some suggestions 1st approach lists of providers patients and health centres in an object that allows access to the items of desired criteria - although the container object say a provides the methods for searching/querying please think about whether a really should contain the logic for searching/querying think about single responsibility principle cohesion coupling etc. - i recommend you to have a look into the data access object pattern and how it handles the case like yours. fully applying the pattern is likely to be an overkill but the motivation behind it and how it improves the design is something to take a note of. 2nd approach searching object - in this case the classes patient provider and centre should all inherit from the same parent class that abstracts over the common searching methods across the three concrete classes. and in light of ocp amp dip your searching object should only depend on such methods i.e. depend only on the higher level module . - however please note that patients providers and centres have different criteria with which they will be queried for e.g. centres by suburb providers by service type . this makes it difficult to abstract out their commonalities - in this case you should ask yourself whether this really is a flexible design i am not saying it s definitely bad just saying that you should take extra care - if this cannot be implemented easily try not to overcomplicate the code or introduce unnecessary complexity by blindly applying the design principles - sometimes simple designs are better. as for the second question passing in an object a as a parameter to the constructor of object b does not necessarily imply a composition relationship - the thing with class-to-class relationship is that it depends on the situation. a composition relationship holds whenever the lifetime of the contained object depends on the lifetime of the container object and passing in the contained object as a parameter to the constructor of the container object is just one way to allow such relationship to hold but it does not necessarily enforce it - why . cheers random babble on design please be aware that it is completely fine to use simpler design when there is no issue with the design i.e. sometimes applying the design principles too early introduces unnecessary complexity and involves you guessing the direction of change in the specs which may not be clear at the time of implementation or a change may not even occur in which case you would have had done unnecessary work - yagni . on the other hand simpler designs are often more comprehensible and can be transformed more flexibly to the changes in the requirements through refactoring. this is because the design principles are principles not laws that you must always follow. that being said some designs bring benefits immediately to the system and a simple design may be completely awful when the system itself becomes large or complex e.g. a series of if statements checking for the type of an object this suggests that you should make use polymorphism to improve the design so you must be judicious with applying this idea.","theta":1,"count":0}]},{"_id":"5cb94a07f65c1605cd8dc148","intent":"assignments","courseCode":"COMP1531","tags":[{"name":"forums","salience":0.5,"theta":1},{"name":"assignments","salience":0.5,"theta":1},{"name":"group

your flask app server is not supporting the post method for that route and this is so for your case because routes in flask only support the get method by default. you can fix this simply by specifying which methods should be supported as a parameter to the route decorator e.g. app.route '/login' methods 'get' 'post' - now this will allow both get and post methods to be used. 2. using get method not recommended for security reasons you may also choose to send form inputs via get method in which case the input values can be retrieved by doing something like make request.args.get 'make'

pattern and generally what it does. the actual fine details is taught in 2511. for your interest strategy pattern enables selection of algorithms at run time. essentially what happens is there is a behaviour or algorithm class which abstracts multiple types of algorithms ie. sort abstracts quicksort bubblesort yet all the types of sorts are in their own class and implement sort function differently. run-time means that during execution of code we can essentially inject this sorting behaviour by instantiating a sort object one that extends sort class and placing it inside any object

abstract class. further the class shape would define methods area and scale but as it does not know how these methods are implemented that depends on the type of the shape it must define these methods as abstract methods forcing the classes derived from shape to implement the behaviour. the classes rectangle and circle can now inherit from the abstract class shape define their individual attributes and override the methods area scale to define their specific implementation. method overriding is a feature where derived classes can override the implementation of the methods defined in the super
