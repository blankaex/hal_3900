I understand *n means it is a pointer to where the memory is located while n means the actual address of the memory, is this correct? When do I use *n and when do I use n? Thank you. Regards, Raymond ","answers":[" *n means that the parameter value being passed is a pointer to a BigNum structure. n means that the parameter value being passed is an actual BigNum object. You use no star if you simply want to supply a value to a function (this is analogous to regular function arguments in maths). You use a star if you want to pass in a pointer to an object in the caller, and the intention of the function is to change the thing being pointed to. Think about scanf(\"%d\",&amp;x) . The intention is to change the value of x , so we need to pass a pointer to x to the scanf function. All of this might become clearer when we see how functions are implemented in MIPS.
