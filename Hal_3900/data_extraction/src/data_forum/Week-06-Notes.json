There is no difference in the output from the mips file or c file, I'm guessing its just the terminal's behaviour. They seem quite worried about it so I just want to check that's fine ","answers":[" That's fine. How fast have they got the scrolling going? If I make it fast enough on my Mac (in a local Terminal window), I get exactly the same problem. We're actually going to comment out the call to delay when we test their programs. Why sit there waiting minutes for the tests to run, when you could run them in (sub) seconds. ",[" awesome, thanks! "]]}]}
