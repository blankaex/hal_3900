The general consensus was that it wasn't difficult , just laborious. Most students agreed that there wasn't much thinking required as the C code was given, and felt like they were simply machine-transcribing. A common complaint was that debugging was difficult, and many students said they would've liked to have been taught how to use qtspim more thoroughly. Another suggestion was for the assignment to be less \"all-or-nothing\", i.e. having milestones so that students who didn't get the program completely working could still receive marks for their effort. ","answers":[" The assignment is not \"all-or-nothing\". The auto-marking (when I get a chance to do it) is a first-cut. If it works, then they get full marks for that part and then you assess the style. If it doesn't work, then you need to look at how close they got and award a partial \"performance\" mark based on that. "]},null,null]}
