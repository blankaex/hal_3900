A lot of the students I had seemed to be still wrapping their heads around the * and &amp; notation and what each means. I thought the struct example was helpful to demonstrate that. Some are struggling to remember things about strings and were trying to do things like char *str = NULL; and then trying to read content from file into the NULL pointer. Today about 6 students wanted to make their own challenge exercises in the lab and demo them, which was pretty exciting to see on a Friday afternoon. We had a rotation encoder and couple of other interesting ideas. A few students had issues with exceeding their disk quotas again after accidentally writing some massive files, and a couple accidentally printed their cat4 compiled program files after trying to cat argv[0], otherwise not too many issues.
