Do you mean like a jump-and-link in MIPS? Also what is the C syntax for this? Thanks ","answers":[" I was referring to function calls. But as I hope you're starting to see, C functions calls do a lot more than just this. Feel free to argue that my analogy is crappy ",[" Thanks for your quick reply! I'm still a little bit confused about how to perform function calls in simplified c. Should we call regularly, using goto or some other method? Thanks ",[" It would be very difficult to implement function calls in C just using goto . Just make a regular function call, knowing that it maps to jal function , followed by some stack setup. And return maps to: set $v0, clean up the stack frame, then jr $ra . "]]]}]}
