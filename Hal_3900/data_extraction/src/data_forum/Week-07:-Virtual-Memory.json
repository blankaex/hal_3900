{"posts":[null,null,null,{"tags":[{"name":"Forums"},{"name":"Lab Classes"},{"name":"Week 07: Virtual Memory"}],"question":" Can a page be modified without being loaded first? ","answers":[" Hi Farhan, Yes and no... modifying a page will require loading it into physical memory. However it could happen in one \"step\" in your vm simulation. So, if a page is currently Not Loaded, and your operation on that page is a write, you will need to 'Load' it in to the frame table and set it to modified. This operation would still also count as a load because the page is being both loaded and written to. "]}]}
