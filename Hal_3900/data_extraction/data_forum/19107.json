asked both of my classes about lecture attendance as well the general consensus is that most are quite satisfied with the quality and promptness of lecture recordings a frequent comment was that playing the lectures at 2x speed makes it appear as if jas is speaking at a normal speed other benefits mentioned include not needing to travel to uni being able to rewatch certain parts of the lecture and skip parts as well the latter isn t so much about lecture content but rather a student apparently introduces himself as raymond and frequently asks long questions that derail the lecture perhaps it might be more economical to make all lecture streams web streams in the future i also have a number of students who have previously completed comp2121 and comp1521 has not been excluded for them for some reason i even have a student who is currently enrolled in comp6447 and i can tell he really does not belong in comp1521 i think the entire prereq exclusion business is a bit of a mess at the moment also regarding the quiz about lecture pace i understood this to mean the rate at which content was introduced however a number of students seem to have interpreted this as how fast jas talks without clarification the quiz results might not be entirely accurate","answers":["i second the exclusion comment some of my friends and others i have heard of have taken comp1917 1927 2121 others and were told by the student office to do comp1521 anyway because that s what the degree says after changing degrees etc a lot of them find the subject a bit of a breeze as a result but i feel like in time the possibility for this to happen will be ruled out eventually"]},{"tags":[{"name":"forums","salience":0.5,"theta":1},{"name":"tutors weekly","salience":0.5,"theta":1},{"name":"weekly

i asked a lot of students individually this week about lectures and a lot of them 50 said they usually prefer to watch lectures later at home because they can watch it at 2x speed and do it in their own time pace about 25 of them said they still go to lectures the other 25 said they just weren t keeping up and planned to catch up i think it s worth noting that there s a portion of second years that didn t take this subject last year for whatever reason and are able to cruise through the labs content without attending lectures or doing much revision as they feel a lot more comfortable with programming at this stage they seem quite switched on in the tutes and labs and are usually first to finish too most people said they were quite comfortable with the lab this week a fair few of them finished early the tut content seemed to be pretty easy to follow for almost all of them","answers":["the point about 2nd years is interesting if that were a general issue then we could change the pre reqs to require an extra programming course and then talk about the implementation of linked data structures however we are constrained by the fact that other schools e g eet have comp1911 gt comp1521 as their only required comp courses and they re not going to be willing to add another course it might be worth drilling down to find out how students who have just done either comp1511 or comp1911 are finding the course is comp1911 sufficient preparation as for why cse students might do the course in 2nd year some of the programs e g binf and seng have it scheduled in 2nd year in the program description for those students it s a dip into how computer systems work under the hood and that s about all they need these degrees have other constraints about courses to take in year 1 also i was trying to balance the size of classes in the two semesters rather than enrolments one semester being twice as large as in the other semester",["i taught comp1911 last semester as well as the bridging course those that did both seem like they re coping just fine in comp1911 whenever i see them and ask although that might be just because the bridging course takes students in a first in and best dressed manner i would say comp1911 has enough preparation to cope with comp1521 in general though we didn t cover structs in overly great detail nor did we make them to use them as much as compared to comp1511 pointers were only used for passing things by reference value and we tended not to go into detail about the layout of things in memory beyond bits bytes and size but i would say students who got over 60 in comp1911 seemingly quite a few are well equipped to tackle comp1521",["honestly i m not sure why comp1911 exist for eet students imo eet students should be doing comp1511 i m curious to know why eet students are told to do comp1911 and not forced in comp1511"]]]},{"tags":[{"name":"forums","salience":0.5,"theta":1},{"name":"tutors
