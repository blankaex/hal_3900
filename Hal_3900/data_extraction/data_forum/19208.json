So basically the command below was not working for me. ./cat1 &lt; /home/cs1521/web/18s2/labs/week01/WarAndPeace.txt &gt; /tmp/WP.out but the next command: time ./cat1 &lt; /home/cs1521/web/18s2/labs/week01/WarAndPeace.txt &gt; /dev/null worked for me. Also doing a quick search online i found this link: https://www.archive.org/stream/warandpeace030164mbp/warandpeace030164mbp_djvu.txt ",[" Thank you very much! Your command is correct!

Is it okay if i use gcc? ","answers":[" dcc is a python script that Andrew Taylor wrote, so it won't be in any package manager. Since it's a wrapper around gcc ( clang ) you might be able to get it to work on your laptop by grabbing the Python script (and whatever else it needs) and tweaking it yourself. Using gcc is fine. If you can use gdb as well, then you won't miss dcc too much. An alternative is to use Vlab on your laptop, and then you get the full CSE environment. "]}]}
