I have tried incrementing in only the suggested spot, as well as combinations including when an already loaded file is modified. None of these seem to produce the expected output. When exactly should nSaves be incremented? ","answers":[" Hi Eleni, yes the nWrites counter is nSaves in the program. The value is there to keep track of how many \"saves to disk\", so you should increment it whenever a modified page is booted from the frame table ( or memframes) to indicate that the changes would have been saved to disk.

","answers":[" Hi Farhan, Yes and no... modifying a page will require loading it into physical memory. However it could happen in one \"step\" in your vm simulation. So, if a page is currently Not Loaded, and your operation on that page is a write, you will need to 'Load' it in to the frame table and set it to modified. This operation would still also count as a load because the page is being both loaded and written to. "]}]}
