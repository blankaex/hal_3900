So I change fopen(HISTFILE, \"r\") to fopen(HISTFILE, \"a+\" ) to make it happen. Just realized this so I got 1.78 late submission mark. Just wondering if I didn't make this change, which will result in my original code completely unexecutable(seg fault) if mymysh_history doesn't exist at the first place, will I get 0 mark for performance?
