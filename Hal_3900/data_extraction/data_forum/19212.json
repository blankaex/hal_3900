Executables for qtspim are available for most operating systems from http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/ . If you want to use the spim command-line interface on your own machine, you'll need to download the source code from SourceForge and compile it yourself, after modifying the Makefile in the spim/ subdirectory of the source code to tell make where to install the executable and the exception handling code. After doing that, installation is as simple as running &lt;nobr&gt;make; make install&lt;/nobr&gt; . This is true on MacOS (with gcc installed) and Linux. I haven't tried to install spim on Windows. \" This didnt make a lot of sense to me unfortunately. How do i compile the soure code, where do i find it ( i downloaded the zip, not sure what im looking for, maybe the spim.cpp file? ), how do i modify the makefile ( as below ) ? \" after modifying the Makefile in the spim/ subdirectory of the source code to tell make where to install the executable and the exception handling code. \" Got lost here. Im using a mac but I don't think I have installed gcc. Is any of this necessary if i'm using tigerVNC? Thanks. ","answers":[" It sounds easier for you to use vla "]}]}
