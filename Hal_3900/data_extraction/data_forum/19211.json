What could be the problem? Expected Output: My output: Any help appreciated! thanks ","answers":[" I had the same issue before because I put the frac, exp and sign the wrong way round when defining the bit fields, so that may be the problem (look back at q1 of the lab) "," It's hard to tell what's actually the problem without seeing your code, but put the result you're getting is very likely to have the last 8 bits in the fraction part unset. I was able to generate the same float using 0 10000111 11111111111111100000000 using a working calculator. Perhaps look through your code and try to work out why it might be doing that but printing the 'bits' value out correctly. "]}]}
