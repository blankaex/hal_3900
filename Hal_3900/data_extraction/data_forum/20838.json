Does this block imply calling the atexit function or is it just checking if atexit() returns a valid value? Thanks! ","answers":[" atexit() registers a function to be called at termination. In this example there is a function bye() that is being registered. The if statement is executed if atexit() fails. That is, if bye() can't be registered. So the call to atexit() happens when you see it. The call to bye() happens when main returns. ",[" I understand. Thanks! "]]}]}
