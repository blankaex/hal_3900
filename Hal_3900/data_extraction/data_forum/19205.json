Why the answer is 2 instead of 99 (1 page for the code and 98 pages for the big array)? The working set of a process could be defined as the set of pages being referenced by the process over a small window of time. This would naturally include the pages containing the code being executed, and the pages holding the data being accessed by this code. Consider the following code which computes the sum of all values in a very large array: int bigArray[100000];...int sum = 0;for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; i++) sum += bigArray[i]; Answer the questions below under the assumptions that: pages are 4KB; all of the above code fits in a single page; the sum and i variables are implemented in registers; there is just one process running in the system. How large is the working set of this piece of code? ","answers":[" From my understanding, you just need 2 because when the OS is managing each process, you only ever need to see the code you're looking at (1 page) and then 1 other page for the array part you're looking at. The whole thing with the working set model is that you don't or should not load all pages up because that is unnecessary since you only will look at each page in terms of the array section maybe once and if they are needed to be looked at again, then they will be loaded up again. Otherwise the remaining total pages in the 'whole system' could/would be allocated to other segments for other processes. ",[" Correct.
