parameter value being passed is a pointer to a bignum structure n means that the parameter value being passed is an actual bignum object you use no star if you simply want to supply a value to a

ways depending on what happens in the underlying system this is going to be a recurring theme in this course this is why we want you to understand what happens when the program executes looking at the
