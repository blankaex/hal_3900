Many of them are similar to exercises you may have done in COMP1511. You can access the page here: http://z5214348.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/prac/ Notes : All of the MIPS exercises I've made available have 10 autotests you can run using check (similar to how we do for lab exercises) and have starting code (usually just a main function skeleton or a simple loop to iterate through an array and print out values). I also made a simple utility to run MIPS code called 'run' which is included in the 'code.zip' in each practice exercise- it's just a basic C program which will either run '1521 spim -file &lt;file&gt;' if on a CSE machine or 'spim -file &lt;file&gt;' if on your home computer (assuming it can find the executable). Also, it will default to running exe.s or main.s files if it can find them in the current directory, or you can pass in a MIPS file as the first argument (./run &lt;mips file&gt;). I hope that some of you find these exercises useful. I'll be posting more up as the week goes by - it takes me a while to sort out the autotests. If there is a high demand for them, then I'll also post sample solutions for all of the exercises I can. Kind regards and happy studying!

"," Hi Robert, I'm not sure if this answers your question or not, let me know if anything is still unclear. When we use the fork() function, the operating system creates a new process for us that is a (fairly) exact copy of the parent. The new process has its own address space (think virtual memory that we just did in the labs) but initially it copies the parent's address space. It assigns this new process a pid. The parent and the child will then run as separate processes. From the fork, the parent gets a return value: the OS hands it the pid of the new process (child) just created. In the child, we also return from fork (even though technically the child didn't exist when the fork was called), and the OS hands the child process 0 as the return value. If we want to check if it's the parent or child, we simply check if the return value from fork was 0 or something else.

If it should be multiple of all the elements in the union, it should print 24 because one double is 8 bytes. Someone can explain it for me, please? ","answers":[" In this discussion, there seems to be some confusion between alignment and size Alignment is where the object starts in memory (i.e. its address); size is how many bytes it occupies after its starting address. The size was always going to be close to 19, which is the size of the largest element in the union. The precise size probably depends on the C compiler. Rounding it up the next multiple of 4 above 19 (i.e. 20), would be plausible. Some other compilers might round it up to the next multiple of 8, if it needed to be aligned for the most restricted-alignment component in the union (which would be 8, because of the double). If you had an array of these unions, that would be a plausible scenario. But this assumes that a double is 8 bytes. Is this guaranteed? In any event, these kinds of considerations point out that trying to analyse things at a level close to the machine leads to revealing machine and compiler dependencies. "," A union takes the size of its largest member. I compiled your code character for character and got size was 24, although I had to use \"%lu\". You might have forgotten to compiled or saved then compiled, so updating your file, otherwise I am not sure. ",[" uh... the size should have been 20. And when I compile it, it gives me 20. Remember that the size of the union will be the largest of its members. This is because it only stores enough space for only one element (the largest one). One way to think of it is that the address of name is the same as the address of x, which is the same as the address of i. In this case, the largest element is the array, which is 19 characters long. However the size of the union is not 19 bytes, because it adds a byte at the end to keep it 4 bytes aligned. ",[" Why should it be multiple of 4 bytes? Is it because every computer is aligned like that, in terms of union memory allocation? I read somewhere that the size of UNION should be multiple of every element and at least the largest of the element, the 2 conditions must be satisfied. And a double is 8 bytes. ",[" I think you miss understood what you read on the internet. It’s not multiple, but alignment. Integers are 4 byte aligned, hence since it is part of the union - the union is 4 byte aligned. This is not strictly necessarily, but some compilers - such as gcc - do this alignment. Why didn’t it align to a double. Tbh I’m not sure. If I had to take a guess, it would be that, since cpu registers are 32bits (in a 32bit computer), then accessing a double is a two instruction operation anyway.

Then, try to print the specific variable values at that part of the program and see if they are what you expect them to be. Some things to consider: when we declare a local variable, the memory is uninitialised.

","answers":[" c doesn't have an inbuilt way of getting the size of an int array, you would usually store the size of the array and use that (the way you did it the first time). Edit: The second way doesn't work because you are checking the pointer value p is not NULL, rather than the value at x[9] which would be gotten with *p. You can generally set a guard at the end of an array that tells it when to stop. This is how strings work with '/0'. In your example you are trying to use a similar technique with an int array - but you will have to manually set the guard value at the end of the array. NULL is a pointer value so you won't be able to set an int to NULL. Another way is to calculate the final address in the array and use that to terminate the loop.
