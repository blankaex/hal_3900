or 1000 depending on whatever nscols is where as if i were to use number of columns as biglength then it goes from 0 9 to 10 which seems more natural and correct atm my code compiles and runs but it s

after its starting address the size was always going to be close to 19 which is the size of the largest element in the union the precise size probably depends on the c compiler rounding it up the next multiple of 4 above 19 i e 20 would be plausible some other compilers might round it up to the next multiple of 8 if it needed to be aligned for the most restricted alignment component in the union which would be 8 because of the double if you had an array of these unions that would be a plausible scenario but this assumes that a double is 8 bytes is this guaranteed in any event these kinds of considerations point out that trying to analyse things at a level close to the machine leads to revealing machine and compiler dependencies","a union takes the size of its largest member i compiled your code character for character and got size was 24 although i had to use lu you might have forgotten to compiled or saved then compiled so updating your file otherwise i am not sure",["uh the size should have been 20 and when i compile it it gives me 20 remember that the size of the union will be the largest of its members this is because it only stores enough space for only one element the largest one one way to think of it is that the address of name is the same as the address of x which is the same as the address of i in this case the largest element is the array which is 19 characters long however the size of the union is not 19 bytes because it adds a byte at the end to keep it 4 bytes aligned",["why should it be multiple of 4 bytes is it because every computer is aligned like that in terms of union memory allocation i read somewhere that the size of union should be multiple of every element and at least the largest of the element the 2 conditions must be satisfied and a double is 8 bytes",["i think you miss understood what you read on the internet it s not multiple but alignment integers are 4 byte aligned hence since it is part of the union the union is 4 byte aligned this is not strictly necessarily but some compilers such as gcc do this alignment why didn t it align to a double tbh i m not sure if i had to take a guess it would be that since cpu

the location of the segfault you could try running the code with gdb to debug or you could try using printf statements in various places in your code to give you a clue where the program is getting up to and what function it is breaking in then try to print the specific variable values at that part of the program and see if they are what you expect them to be some things to consider when we declare a local variable the memory is uninitialised if we don t assign it it could have any value possibly quite large inside segfaults very commonly occur in arrays when we are iterating over them and access an area out of bounds think about how this relates to point 1 it s best if you don t post actual lab code on the forum test output is fine but not code files but you can either take it to a

would be another way to determine the end of an integer array when we define an integer array whatever by malloc or simply declaration we would know its size hence we could loop through the array by index but array of integer doesn t have 0 in its end hence what could be another way to determine the case of terminating the loop for example here i would like to fill in an array with 9 this for loop runs much more times than 10 and trigged seg fault at last it seems p null is not the case that p reaches end of x what could be the correct way to exit instead of the way in comment thank you","answers":["c doesn t have an inbuilt way of getting the size of an int array you would usually store the size of the array and use that the way you did it the first time edit the second way doesn t work because you are checking the pointer value p is not null rather than the value at x 9 which would be gotten with p you can generally set a guard at the end of an array that tells it when to stop this is how strings work with 0 in your example you are trying to use a similar technique with an int array but you will have to manually set the guard value at the end of the array null is a pointer value so you won t be able to set an int to null another way is to calculate the final address in the array and use that to terminate the loop you would have seen an example of that in
