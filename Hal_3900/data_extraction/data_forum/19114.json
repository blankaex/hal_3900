The general consensus was that it wasn't difficult , just laborious. Most students agreed that there wasn't much thinking required as the C code was given, and felt like they were simply machine-transcribing. A common complaint was that debugging was difficult, and many students said they would've liked to have been taught how to use qtspim more thoroughly. Another suggestion was for the assignment to be less \"all-or-nothing\", i.e. having milestones so that students who didn't get the program completely working could still receive marks for their effort. ","answers":[" The assignment is not \"all-or-nothing\". The auto-marking (when I get a chance to do it) is a first-cut. If it works, then they get full marks for that part and then you assess the style. If it doesn't work, then you need to look at how close they got and award a partial \"performance\" mark based on that.

I think an exercise with forking is a good idea though, eg. fork to a particular depth and then stop, or create N children and print pids/info about them without making a fork-bomb. Or maybe extending the alternating process one so they are writing the majority of the code for it themselves, perhaps they'll understand it a bit better having been through the process. I thought the assignment seemed fairly straightforward, the main thing students are asking me for help with is memory exceptions and not being sure how to debug them. Perhaps they're having more issues because there's more movement of data and calculating the addresses is a bit more in-depth. ","answers":[" I agree with Ellen on the fork lab. On the assignment, most students I spoke to 'completed' their code but couldn't debug it - perhaps less of a chance to test the assignment while writing it was an issue.
