asked for some feedback on assignment 1 the general consensus was that it wasn t difficult just laborious most students agreed that there wasn t much thinking required as the c code was given and felt like they were simply machine transcribing a common complaint was that debugging was difficult and many students said they would ve liked to have been taught how to use qtspim more thoroughly another suggestion was for the assignment to be less all or nothing i e having milestones so that students who didn t get the program completely working could still receive marks for their effort","answers":["the assignment is not all or nothing the auto marking when i get a chance to do it is a first cut if it works then they get full marks for that part and then you assess the style if it doesn t work then you need to look at how close they got and award a partial performance mark based on that"]},{"tags":[{"name":"forums","salience":0.5,"theta":1},{"name":"tutors

found last semester that the fork lab was completed fairly quickly but most students didn t seem to understand it unless we walked them through what was happening i think an exercise with forking is a good idea though eg fork to a particular depth and then stop or create n children and print pids info about them without making a fork bomb or maybe extending the alternating process one so they are writing the majority of the code for it themselves perhaps they ll understand it a bit better having been through the process i thought the assignment seemed fairly straightforward the main thing students are asking me for help with is memory exceptions and not being sure how to debug them perhaps they re having more issues because there s more movement of data and calculating the addresses is a bit more in depth","answers":["i agree with ellen on the fork lab on the assignment most students i spoke to completed their code but couldn t debug it perhaps less of a chance to test the assignment while writing it was an issue"]},{"tags":[{"name":"forums","salience":0.5,"theta":1},{"name":"tutors weekly","salience":0.5,"theta":1},{"name":"weekly

don t know the 18s1 labs but if it s like the fork lab from 17s2 it was nice in that it really made students understand how forking worked so i think it has its place as far as other labs if they aren
