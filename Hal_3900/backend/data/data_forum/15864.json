Welcome and welcome back for new tutors and coming back tutors. Thanks for agreeing to take tutes and lab classes for COMP1521 in 18s2. From last Semester experience I would like to make the following comments and please feel free to add to it. 1- The class is extremely big and we have to deal with lots of labs and submissions. Every lab has one tutor and one assistance. During the lab, I found that the best option is that the tutor helps students while the assistant marks the previous lab and put it in the sms. When you mark a student, please check if his/her all previous labs submitted and marked. 2- If you are unable to attend your lab for whatever reason, PLEASE write in here, I will do my best to cover you or have someone to do so. However, If you could find someone to replace you, that would be great too. In any replacement case you will need to fill THIS FORM and please you don'y have to email Mei Cheng. 3- We will talk about the assignment submission and marking whenever its due. 4- The most complaints I received last semester is about marks. Some people have their marks visible and some did not get it. We should of try to have all labs going together. I know it is not easy especially with the large number we are having this semester. Please, just do you best. Good Luck all, Have fun :) Wael ","answers":[]}]}
