Mainly because I had students whose code had one features working + attempted two others and got more marks .... than those who attempted 3 features successfully but had a printing error. I reckon it is better if we deduct -1 for a serious error (like printing the dash line before the “Running program ...”, and -0.5 for spelling errors (like “Return 0” instead of “Returns 0”). ","answers":[" How about reducing the penalty as you suggested but have a hard cap of 7/9 for code with formatting errors? ",[" I've been interpreting \" If some tests really fail and if they have formatting errors on the rest, work out their mark without formatting errors, and, if it's more then 7/9, set the mark to 7/9 with a comment about the formatting. \" as essentially that ",[" Oh I understand that sentence now. I’m glad I brought it up. Thanks Oliver "]],[" yeah i second that. "]]}]}
