A fair number of students used powers of two, and those who did use left shifts didn't use the or operator to set bits, but rather just integer arithmetic. Perhaps students might still be a bit confused about binary operators.

We got through the three topics but I felt like it was a lot to cover in one go and I wasn't able to go into too much depth with implementation of unions in C. I also wished I'd covered bit-fields in the tute as some people were still a bit confused about them and I hadn't thought to cover it. A few of my students today submitted partial solutions to last week's BigNum lab and said they got quite lost with it. I'm not sure if they just didn't spend the time working it out or they were genuinely confused about some of the concepts (or maybe a bit of both). ","answers":[]}]}
