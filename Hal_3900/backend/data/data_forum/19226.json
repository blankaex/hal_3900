When submitting my assignment draft via `give` I'm given the following error message: Submission: assign1------------------------------Files found: scroll.s------------------------------[assign1 dryrun] Checking syntax of 'scroll.s'...cat: /web/cs1521/18s2/assignments/assign1/code/chars.s: Permission deniedSubmission test failed.

I don't expect my submission to pass the test anyway in its current state but I thought I should raise it just in case. Best, Joe ","answers":[" Whoops! I'll fix that now. The dryrun test just passes your code through SPIM to make sure your syntax and labels are correct. It's not a substitute for real testing! We'll have real tests up within the next few days. "]}]}
