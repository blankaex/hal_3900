I'm not sure how to fix this other than to cover that content in tutorials (which cuts into interesting tutorial discussion) or in labs (which cuts into lab time); I don't like those solutions. ","answers":[" I noticed this today as well, a lot of students needed walking through the warmup exercise and didn't understand 2s complement and that you can do binary operations on 'int' values in c. Once they understood that I saw some clever solutions to the warmup. I can't find any labs under the Webcms3 marking page, is the marking set up for labs? ",[" I too noticed that a lot of the students didn't understand the concept of negative numbers, 2's complement, etc. Another thing that students didn't understand was casting! Might be worth explaining casting in the lecture if it hasn't already. "]]}]}
