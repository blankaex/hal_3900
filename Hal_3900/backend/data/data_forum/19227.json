short answer we re interested in the characters your code outputs not how it s painted by a heap of very slow software emulating an even slower terminal the slightly longer and less cryptic answer the approach we re using in painting the marquee to the terminal is extremely naive for every frame we clear everything and then paint everything in an ideal world the terminal could work out how to turn this into partial updates of the screen in practice what you re seeing is that not happening the way terminals work hasn t really changed much since 1978 with the introduction of the dec vt 100 terminal the terminals we use today or more accurately terminal emulators pretend to be vt 100 relatives of various denominations these were powered by intel 8080 processors running at a blistering two megahertz and with very nearly no memory and words like optimised display update algorithm weren t the domain of hardware the sequences of characters in the clear label if i recall correctly something like 033 h 033 2j is magic to clear all characters on the screen the terminal emulator meditates upon its idea of what the screen looks like and updates it character by character or sequence by sequence so each step occurs effectively separately at low speed the terminal emulator and the rest of the graphics pipeline can keep up but at high speed the terminal has to be painting nearly continuously which can cause the frame that s pushed into the raster buffer to be incorrect what you re likely seeing then is a weird combination of multiple frames one fully painted with the cursor placed after the last newline and one that s being painted with a cursor being placed before characters are exactly what is causing that would be a fun well fun weekend exercise in following data through the baklava like layers of thin flaky delicious abstractions an interesting challenge and one not worth marks but worth many many kudos and or mars bars devise a faster screen painting

thank you in advance","answers":[{"text":"hi feng you questions seem a little bit ambiguous so for your first question why are you saying that the actual bytes we use is 9000 are you saying nscols is at size 9000 but that is not the total bytes we will use that s just the number of bytes the bigstring colum will use hence the actual byte bigstring uses is multipled by nrows and that is the maximum number of bytes it will take and if you are saying what will happen if the input is shorter than the maximum then i would recommend you to read through the setupdisplay function variable thelength is passed to setupdisply function to tell setupdisplay to stop setting up as long as it hits the end of your input so it won t keep printing until reach the end of the bigstring and for your question 2 are you saying after the first iteration the program will show the first column of bigstring and yes it will since the starting col is set to ndcols 1 and i don t think we need to make it show nothing in the first iteration as the assignment specification just asked us to translate the c program but if you want u can simply set starting col to ndcols it will fix the problem and i also think you have some misunderstandings with respect to bigstring and display because if you want to change the starting column that will show after the first iteration you should alter the arrary display rather than big string as bigstring constantly stores the big version of our input and will not be altered once it is created and display is the actual picture of every frame we see from the command
