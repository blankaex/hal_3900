#### Check up on progress

- ELLEN:
	- Web scraper
		- Works on certain sections of tests
		- Async is causing headaches
		    - Could use python? prob ok to stick to js
		    - @Zain look through admin webcms and send useful think to ellen
		- Current issue: follow through web graph
		- Works mostly pretty well
		- Next task: chuck @ google cloud to classify
		- Using cheerio (scraping toolset)
- YI:
	- ML information retrieval vs generative
		- Information Retrieval
			- Works by qurying from user and converting to a DB data set retrivial
			- Need enough querys for every example so we can answer it
			- Easier to do
			- Less "smart"
		- Generative
			- Every word is a vector 
			- Calculare a score of each sentence
			- Use algorithm to match, can give more meaningful responses even with less direct matched questions
			- Much more difficult to implement
		- Thoughts
			- Dataset might be just too small for generative
			- Worry is that by the time we get to training we realise it won't work with our data set and we are too far in to piviot
			- Lets stick with Information Retrieval to get a base working
			- Can augment it a lot as time goes by
				- add some back learning
				- can focus to NLP side if be
			- Kinda requires some level of handling queries
- HAYDEN:
	- Setup backend boilerplate with `Node.js`
	- Basic boilerplate in pure `Node.js` (refer to previous commit)
	- Wrote basic quickstart steps in `/Hal_3900/readme.md` 
	- Redid boilerplate with `express` to manage routing, content-type checking, etc.
	- Routes specified in `/Hal_3900/routes.js`
	- Serves static `.html` files from `/public`
	- Development mode server runs with `nodemon` (automatically restarts server on file touch)

	- Need a frontend to interact with `Node.js`
	- Getting the right versions of `Node.js` and `@vue-cli` took over 3 hours 
		- SocketIO is possible    
		- `TensorFlow 2.0` came out a few days ago, we should use it
		- Resources
			- extra stuff in github to help us learnding
- ZAIN:
	- Frontend framework is set up 
		- Need to talk hayden to interact with backend

#### Plan what to get done by friday

- ZAIN:
	- Get frontend working frontend up by friday
	- Get backend interaction by friday
	- Start dockerising
	- Send any relevant web scraper tips to ellen (chuck them on the card)
	- IF POSSIBLE: take a look at the web scraping code
	- Set up milestones
- ELLEN:
	- Continue with web scraping
	- Start looking into tag data with google tag stuff
- YI: 
	- Start to code information retrival
	- Use test data if needed.
- HAYDEN:
	- Implement `MongoDB` support for persistent storage
	- Figure out how frontend and backend are supposed to interact
		- Somehow I feel like serving static files won't quite cut it
		- ZAIN: we just need a basic api for this sprint and a home page
	- Add some other standard middleware like body-parser, cors, etc
		- we can do this as the need arrives from features
