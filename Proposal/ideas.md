# Tech Stack 
dialog flow looks pretty good for the NLP 
python backend to interact withour NLP library
vue frontend to provide a nice user interface to interact with the bot and to let the bot throw 
dialogs / live render relevant animations. 

# Ideas 
Have the bot listen in on conversations where a tutor is present to learn off the interaction. 
>> We need a source of data (course FAQ's? stack overflow? google images?)

Can be an assistant to a tutor rather then a replacement
    - Will remind people of deadlines
    - Do basic math evalualations
    - remember links to assignments
        - hey bot when's the next assignment due?
        - 5 weeks! it's a big assignment though so you want to start early
    - stack overflow integration / can parse language docs?
        - bot max size of a python integeer
        - python doesn't have a max size, it will dynamically allocate memory
    - how does X work
        - Here's a userful diagram

A good feature is being able to throw an assignment at it and it can handle questions via the spec (most questions tutors get are of this form)
but in addition if any question stumps the bot it can email a tutor that maybe the spec is vauge.
 
I really think we should push the diagram angle / google image searching. explaining a 
complex topic via images is almost always better. 

Also maybe we can have a feature where a student can make their message a spoiler so other people in the group 
have to click on it to see it?

Integrated quizes the bot can ask (and/or flashcards!)
	- yo bot, can you quiz me on pointers
    - sure, what will `int x = 0; printf("%d",&x)` print?

piazza integration?
