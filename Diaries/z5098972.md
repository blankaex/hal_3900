## Week 1  
Since this was the first week, we mostly spent the time sorting out logistics. We formed a group, assigned roles and decided on the topic we wanted to work on. I created the git repo and added a bunch of templates for all of our upcoming tasks, and we created a project board to keep track of our work. We agreed to each take some time to look into ideas that could be potentially relevant to our project, which we will discuss next meeting.

## Week 2
We'd mostly finalised our project last meeting, so the primary focus this week was on writing the proposal. We decided which sections we wanted to write and who would write each one, so we were left to our own devices for the most part. All members, including myself, were able to complete all of our parts on time. I also spent some additional time to fix up the LaTeX, as I encouraged its use despite being the only member of the group familiar with it. Provided there are no issues with our proposal, we will spend the next week beginning research and setting up a boilerplate for our first iteration.
