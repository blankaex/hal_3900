## Week 1  
Since this was the first week, we mostly spent the time sorting out logistics. We formed a group, assigned roles and decided on the topic we wanted to work on. I created the git repo and added a bunch of templates for all of our upcoming tasks, and we created a project board to keep track of our work. We agreed to each take some time to look into ideas that could be potentially relevant to our project, which we will discuss next meeting.
