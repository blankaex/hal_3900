Week 1
We formed a group and decided on our project. We are working on option 1 and decided 
to make a student-tutor chat bot. A few people in our group have tutored before in 
CSE at UNSW and we were all interested in what we could do with this.
We set up the github repo and I helped to make our project board and add some cards.

This week we set a goal to do research for our propsal, come up with ideas for what
we want the chat bot to be able to do and get a better idea of the key problems it 
should solve. I started looking at examples of different bots used in education already
such as in DuoLingo and other online/app education, and came up with some ideas of what
our chat bot might be able to help with / do. I also thought of a lot of questions to 
help the planning process. We will bring our ideas and information together in the week 2 lab.
