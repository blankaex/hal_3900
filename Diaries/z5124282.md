Week 1
This week we formed a group and decided our project topic, which is student tutor chatbot. And then we set up a Github group following the indications of tutor, built a project with labels and proposal cards. I did some research about chatbot algorithm, as well as got some knowledge of how to implement a chatbot. I came up with some ideas of functions of our chatbot and create a raw-graph of it, preparing to discuss in the lab 2 with my group members.
