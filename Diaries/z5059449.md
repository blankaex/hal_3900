Week 1
Formed group, i helped set up the github as scrum master and we decided on which project to do (a education helper chat bot).
We also decided on how to communicate (messenger group) and what to use to manage our project (github projects)
We set a goal to do research on the bot and what tech stack we may wish to use. In addition we were all tasked with getting a better idea of
the problem we wanted this bot to solve and some of the main epics/checkpoints we wanted the bot to have.
