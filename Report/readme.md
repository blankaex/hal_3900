# Project Report

**Marking Criteria:**
* Using the similar format as the project proposal, your report should be at least 12 pages long, excluding the title page, and be in PDF format that is readable with Acrobat on the CSE workstations.
* Title page similar to that of the project proposal, with the project submission date.
* Overview - Architecture/design of the overall system & functionalities (for a joint group project, this section will be common to each group).
* Descriptions of the functionalities developed by the team (and why not â€“ the justifications of the functionalities that are missing/different from the project proposal).
* Proper references and brief descriptions of ALL third - party functionalities (clouds/services/APIs/libraries/code) used by the team, with justification for their use and discussion how their licensing terms impact results of this project.
* Implementation challenges: descriptions of any tricks, non-trivial algorithms, special architecture/design, etc.
* User documentation/manual: how to build, setup, configure, and use your system and functionalities. (For a joint group project, this section can be common for each group, if they merge all functionalities together in one code repositories for final submission; or otherwise, each group shall have a different description in this section.)
* Use either APA (https://student.unsw.edu.au/apa) or Harvard (https://student.unsw.edu.au/harvard-referencing) referencing style
